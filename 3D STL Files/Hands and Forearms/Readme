Here is the list of parts and the number of prints needed for 1 right wrist:

1x rotawrist2
1x rotawrist1

1x WristGears
1x CableHolderWrist
Print wristarge, wristsmall, Thumb, with an infill of 30%, 3 shells, best with no support, no raft.

Print  index3, majeure3, ringfinger3, auriculaire3, with an infill of 30%, 2 shell, best with no support, no raft.
Print robpart2, robpart3, robpart4, robpart5 with an infill of 30%, 3 shell, best with raft, no support.
Print coverfinger with an infill of 30%, 3 shells, with support. To get the best printing result on the covers is to print them standing up, instead laying them flat.

The wrist parts are good printed with an infill of 30%, 3 shells, with no raft, no support. The Gears of the wrist should be printed with the best quality your printer can give you.

Big bolts are now printable. (Strong enough for tests and even more!)
You can replace the 16x3mm for the fingers with pins/pegs of filament instead of bolts, itâ€™s cheap, easy, and strong enough.
It was a suggestion of FreddyA.

1x8mmx8cm bolt  to attach wristlarge to wristsmall.
1x8mmx4cm bolt to attach wriarge to thumbbottom.
1x8mmx6cm bolt  for to attach wriarge to robpart1.
16x3mmx2cm bolts  for all fingers hinges(I have recut each bolt to adapt to finger width)
